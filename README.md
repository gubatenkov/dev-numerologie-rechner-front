## info multilang

In order to add new languages, checkout the following files:

- `src/contexts/UserContext.jsx`
- `src/utils/constants.js`

Additionally, have a look at the files at `src/translations`. The i18n framework access the files from `src/translations/'languageTag'.json`. Currently there is only german active. For testing purpose we added an english version with a prefix `en_` to all texts to check if everything is working. So feel free to enable Englisch in the files above and the frontend and use the languageSwitch in the frontend.

The current workflow for changes is as following:

- Backend has been updated already (see backend readme)
- Add new json to `src/translations`
- Enable THE SAME langTag as in Backend in Frontend. The code has to match exactly, otherwise the lang might not match and the fallback (DE) is used.
